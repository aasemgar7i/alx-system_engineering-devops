Outage Postmortem: Web Server Downtime Incident
Issue Summary
Duration: May 10, 2024, 11:30 AM - 12:45 PM (SAST)
Impact: The web server experienced a complete outage, resulting in a 30-minute downtime for all users. Approximately 80% of users were unable to access the site during this period, leading to a significant disruption in service.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the web server's load balancer settings, leading to improper distribution of incoming traffic.
Timeline
11:30 AM (SAST): Issue detected by monitoring system alerting to server unresponsiveness.
11:35 AM (SAST): Engineers notified of the outage by automated monitoring system.
11:40 AM (SAST): Investigation began into potential causes, focusing initially on database connectivity and server resource utilization.
11:50 AM (SAST): Initial assumption was that database overload might be causing the issue.
12:00 PM (SAST): Increased database connections were temporarily limited, but no improvement in server response.
12:15 PM (SAST): Incident escalated to the network team due to suspicion of load balancer issues.
12:30 PM (SAST): Load balancer misconfiguration identified as root cause.
12:45 PM (SAST): Load balancer settings were corrected, restoring normal server functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The web server outage was caused by incorrect load balancer settings, which were routing traffic improperly, leading to server unavailability.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to ensure proper distribution of incoming requests among available servers.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement regular load balancer configuration audits to catch misconfigurations early.
Enhance monitoring to detect load balancer anomalies promptly.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any further misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to provide real-time visibility into load balancer performance.
Schedule regular load balancer maintenance checks and audits to prevent similar incidents in the future.
